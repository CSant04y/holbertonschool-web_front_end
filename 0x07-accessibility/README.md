# A Crash Course on Accessibility
## Overview
WCAG is a set of guidelines, created by the **W3C**, for making Digital content accessible for all users, including people with disabilities.

### WCAG Timeline
* 1999: WCAG 1.0 released by W3C
* 2008: WCAG 2.0 (current version) released
* 2012: WCAG 2.0 became ISO standard
* 2017: WCAG 2.1 draft under public review
* 2018: WCAG 2.1 became ISO standard
* 2020: WCAG 2.2 working draft and WCAG 3.0 (called “Silver”) is also in working phase

### 4 Principals
The WCAG is organized around 4 principles that are an acronym for **POUR**.
**Perceivable:** can users perceive this content? What may be able to been seen by sighted individuals, cannot be seen by the majority as there are individuals with difficulties.
**Operable:** Can users use the UI componets and navigate the content? For example, something that requires a **hover** option on some UI component, cannot be used by someone who can’t use a mouse or a touch screen. This is very limiting to individuals who need to navigate websites.
**Understandable:** Can the users understand the content? Can users understand the interface  and is consistent enough to avoid confusion. 
**Robust:** Can the content be consumed by a wide variety of user agents(Browsers)? Does it work with assistive technology?

### Accessibility Levels
After the defining of the 4 principals, WCAG  defined 3 different levels, the two first being absolutely required for any business and website. AAA level is recommended but not required as it may have bigger impacts on designs. 

#### Levels
## Level A (required)
**A**: This level improves accessibility for most sites by making it easier for browsing readers to navigate a site and translate its content, but it is still pretty basic.
## Level AA (required)
**AA**: This level makes content accessible to people with a wider range of disabilities by providing guidance on elements such as color contrast and error identification. Regulators prefer this level.
## Level AAA (optional)
**AAA**: The highest level of accessibility compliance, this makes content accessible to the widest range of people, but it can significantly alter the design of a site. Government legislation doesn’t typically require this because it’s not always possible to conform.

## ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)
ARIA is a specification from the W3C and created to improve accessibility of applications by providing extra information to assistive technologies, such as screen readers, via attributes which could be added to HTML.
